# Legendre OPRF
This is an implementation of the Legendre Symbol based OPRF of Beullens et al. [2Hash OPRF framework](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/450.pdf).


The goal of the implementation is to prove the concrete efficiency of this approach. It was tested under WSL on Windows and under Ubuntu. However, this is not an industry-level implementation and there might still be subtle bugs.

## Structure
The implementation relies on the [libOTe](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe) library for the Oblivious Transfer implementations and for the implementation of the Puncturable PRF.
 - `OPRFLeg.h` contains a class that allows to execute the OPRF protocol. The function `eval` is what the OPRF-client executes. It takes an input `x` and writes the OPRF output to `output`. The functin `blindedEval` is what the OPRF-server executes. It takes the key `Key` as input and has no output.
 - The folder `fe25519` contains an implementation of finit field arithmetic for the prime field modulo $2^{255}-19$. The implementation is originally based on [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/install.html) but was adapted to our use.
 - The files `smallSetVoleFast.h`, `VolePlus.h`, `voleUtils.h`, and `LegOPRF_ZKProof.h` contain the building blocks for the OPRF.
 - The folder `tests` contains tests.
 - The files `VolePlus.GMP.h`, `smallSetVoleGMP.h`, and `MockSmallSetVole.h` exist only for testing purposes and can be ignored.

## Building
For building the code, one needs to install a c++ compiler, git,libtool, cmake, GMP, and libOTe (although our final implementation does not make use of GMP).

### Installing Preliminaries:
To install GMP and cmake on Ubuntu, you can run
`sudo apt install libgmp3-dev cmake g++ libtool git`

To install libOTe, you must run the following *in the same folder* where the main file is

`git clone https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe.git`
`cd libOTe`
`python3 build.py --all --boost --sodium`
`python3 build.py --sudo --install`. You will get prompted to enter your sudo password.
In case this does not work, more detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe).

### Building the OPRF
To build the OPRF, you first have to create a build directory
`mkdir build`
`cd build`
Then, you can run CMAKE
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
`cmake --build .`


## Testing
One can run all tests by typing 
`ctest` while in the build folder. (This might take a while)
`ctest -VV` gives more verbose output.

For just running the OPRF one can run
`ctest -R OPRFleg -VV`
